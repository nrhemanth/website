Hi, I am Hemanth (pronounced *hey-month*). Iâ€™m a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by [Prof. Shijing Sun](https://www.uwsunlab.com/). My main research focuses on the digital transformation of battery manufacturing. In addition, I have also been working on generative models for simulating battery profiles for diverse conditions.

Earlier, I completed my MS in Materials Science and Engineering at UW with [Prof. Guozhong Cao](https://mse.washington.edu/facultyfinder/guozhong-cao) and [Prof. Shijing Sun](https://www.me.washington.edu/facultyfinder/shijing-sun). Here, my research was on battery informatics and explainable ML [(thesis)](https://github.com/nrhemanth/MS-thesis/blob/main/docs/MS_thesis_final.pdf). Even earlier, I was an undergraduate at NITK Surathkal, where I was advised by [Prof. K Narayan Prabhu](https://mme.nitk.ac.in/faculty/k-narayan-prabhu).

In the past life, I briefly worked on electrolyzer, two-phase flow and computer vision projects at [Electric Hydrogen](https://eh2.com) in Natick in 2023. There, I was part of the cell physics and electrochemistry team, mentored by [Dr. Elif Karatay](http://www.elifkaratay.com/home.html).


More than research, I enjoy intense sports and activities like swimming, squash, basketball, and hiking (*my list here soon*). When I'm feeling lazy, I play board games or video games, though I end up losing most of the time.

I have a particular taste in movies (*I'll add my list soon*), and I love exploring new coffee and boba places, which I plan to rate (*list coming soon*).
