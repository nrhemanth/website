I have been working on couple of projects to address the challeneges in upscaling the battery technologies using emerging AI tools.

### Research Projects  

#### 1. Cost Modeling the Impact of AI and Robotics on Lithium Metal Battery Manufacturing  
*In collaboration with PPNL.*  
[DOE AMMTO Initiative â€“ $127M for Clean Energy Data Collection and Analysis](https://www.energy.gov/eere/ammto/articles/ammto-announces-127-million-support-data-collection-and-analyses-current-clean)  

#### 2. Generative AI for Battery Informatics and Predictive Modeling  
*In collaboration with Amazon.*  

#### 3. AI-Robotics-Human Collaborative platform for Sustainable Innovations in Battery Manufacturing
